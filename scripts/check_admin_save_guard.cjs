 * check_admin_save_guard.cjs — the editor tells the truth about GitHub
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *     On 2026-09-03 a finished post was published as an older draft. The
 *     save had been refused, so the branch still held the previous version;
 *     Publish merged that branch and reported success, because merging is
 *     all Publish does. Nothing in the editor was in a position to notice.
 *
 *     admin/index.html now watches what Git Gateway actually does and
 *     refuses to publish while the screen is ahead of GitHub. Those are
 *     decisions made in a browser at the worst possible moment, so they are
 *     tested here rather than found out the hard way.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS
 *     - which requests count as a save and which are ignored
 *     - which failures are real and which are Decap tidying up after itself
 *     - whether the screen is ahead of GitHub, including the case where two
 *       writes land in the same millisecond
 *     - which buttons the publish guard stands in front of
 *
 *     The functions are pulled out of admin/index.html as it is on disk, so
 *     this cannot drift away from what actually ships.
 *
 *     .cjs, not .js: package.json says "type": "module", and this uses
 *     require() to read the page off disk.
 *
 * USAGE
 *     node scripts/check_admin_save_guard.cjs
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = every check passed, 1 = something is wrong.
